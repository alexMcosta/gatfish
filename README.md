Gatfish is a CLI application that governs AWS resources for proper tagging. It will do this by taking a YAML file of desired tags per AWS resource and their level of requirement. Gatfish will be able to then perform actions based of these levels such as logging from highest to lowest severity, removing severe culprits, adding tags that can be automatically added.
